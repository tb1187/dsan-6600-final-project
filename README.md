# Use of AI

Artificial intelligence tools (specifically OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5.1) were used throughout the development of this project in the following ways:

• Problem-Solving & Debugging  
  AI assistance was used to help identify and resolve errors in Python scripts, PyTorch model definitions, dataset handling, data loaders, normalization routines, and GUI integration. This included debugging mis-indexing issues, incorrect layer freezing, misapplied transforms, early-stopping logic, and denormalization errors.

• Code Architecture & Refactoring  
  ChatGPT assisted in guiding portions of the project architecture, model-training scripts, evaluation utilities, and the PyQt5 GUI layout. All AI-generated code was manually reviewed, tested, and modified by the project authors.

• Conceptual Clarification  
  Explanations provided by ChatGPT supported understanding of convolutional backbones, transfer learning, normalization, overfitting behavior, and dataset biases. These explanations informed decisions about model selection, training strategy, and preprocessing.

• Report Writing Assistance  
  AI was used to help edit, restructure, and improve clarity in sections such as Methods, Related Work, Training Procedure, Results, and Discussion.
